Once redeemed, the balance is added to the user's PSN wallet, allowing for purchases on the platform.

### How Do They Work?

When you purchase a PSN gift card, the retailer provides you with a code. This code is then entered on the PlayStation Store, adding the corresponding value to your account. The process is straightforward, making it a popular choice for gamers who want to buy content without linking a credit card.
